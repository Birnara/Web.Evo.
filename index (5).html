    <h1>Interactive Financial Calculator</h1>
    <p>Welcome to EvoBank's Interactive Financial Calculator. Our tool is designed to help you easily calculate loan amounts, interest rates, repayment schedules, and more. By entering some basic information, you can get a quick estimate of your loan repayments, enabling you to make better financial decisions.</p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>To use the calculator, simply fill in the fields below, including the loan amount, interest rate, and loan term. Once you've entered your details, click the "Calculate" button, and we'll provide an estimate of your monthly payments, total interest, total repayment, and a visual breakdown of the loan statistics.</p>
